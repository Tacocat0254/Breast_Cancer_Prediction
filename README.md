<H3>Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction</H3>
This project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and classification models to predict breast cancer recurrence using a dataset of patient records. The workflow includes cleaning the data, encoding categorical features, and applying machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression) for binary classification.
