<h3>What did you do to prepare the data?</h3>
I prepared the data by first checking the file type of the given data set. Then, I read the csv file using pandas. After reading the csv file, I check the the shape, size, and data types of the raw data. After that, I check if there are duplicate rows and remove them. Finally, I fill in the missing or invalid values by using the mode method. Finally, I perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables such as age group, breast_quad_..., etc.
